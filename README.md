This is a AI that learns how to play the game "The Sonic the Hedgehog" by itself through Neuro-Evolution.

I have created 2 different programs : agent.py and parallelSonic.py

agent.py will create a single sonic that can learn the game  which can make our process very low.
So, I created parallelSonic.py that can solve this issue. This program will create multiple sonics that can learn the game at the same time. It will make training process
significantly fast.
